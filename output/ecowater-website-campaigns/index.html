      <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>EcoWater is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of residential water treatment systems and has been operating since 1925.</p>
<h2>Project Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>SEO for website development</li>
<li>SEM campaigns</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer Site</h3>
<ul>
<li>ecowater.com</li>

</ul>
<h2>NEW CAMPAIGNS AND WEBSITE TO SOLVE AN OLD PROBLEM</h2>
<p>EcoWaters new CMO was on the line to deliver. A substantial portion of the shared marketing budgeting had been approved by the company's dealer organization's leadership council for a new website and supporting marketing campaigns. If the site didn't deliver leads, she'd be in hard water. Complexity layered on as the site's dealer portal and an entirely separate consumer awareness website also needed TLC.</p>
<p>Active collaboration between our development team and myself in a marketing site balancing the needs of the independent dealers with overarching brands goals. An impressive feat considering the complex international business requirements and technical components. Using keyword research and internal search data from building the website, I was able to provide data-backed insights for future social media posts to a third-party PR agency generating EcoWater's social media posts.</p>
<p>SEM campaigns were launched with the new website to support lead volume. Complex geographic bid modifiers were set up according to water hardness maps and dealer territories. Adding a layer of complexity to the situation were SEM campaigns launched for the consumer-awareness website. Due to the similarities in search terms between the target audiences, careful planning and execution were taken to reduce overlap and cannibalization of marketing funds between the campaigns.</p>
<p>The website and campaign launch were all timed to occur before the dealer organizations annual meeting. I was flown in to present the new website, explain the strategy behind the website design, answer any questions, and ultimately gain their buy-in for the new site. Meeting and talking with the 50+ dealers was exhilarating and inspirational.</p>
