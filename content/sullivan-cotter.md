## VISIBILITY AND INSIGHTS FROM EBLASTS
A leader in the assessment and development of performance-based total rewards programs, Sullivan Cotter, sends a recurring e-blast when they publish new research data in their proprietary platform. Visibility and insights on these e-blasts were lacking. The marketing team needed to know where performance opportunities existed.

I implemented a comprehensive tracking strategy capturing all user engagement points for a large batch of different e-blast templates. Tracking not only provided insight from e-blast engagement but also user activity on their marketing website. These performance insights, along with data from Sullivan Cotter's Constant Contact account, was compiled each month into a dashboard and executive summary. I delivered these reports and additional findings to Sullivan Cotter's leadership via a monthly status call.
