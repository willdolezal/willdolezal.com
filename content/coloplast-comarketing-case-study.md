## COLOPLAST: BUILD LOYALTY & REVENUE WITH CO-MARKETING CAMPAIGNS

### Challenge
A complicated treatment process and minimal loyalty from physicians was leading to poor visibility of the client’s products. I was in charge of increasing awareness and growing relationships with physicians in key geographic markets.

### Project Scope 
- Search Engine Marketing
- Analytics, Reporting
- Conversion Rate Optimization

I set out to build physician loyalty with co-marketing paid search campaigns that would increase the visibility of both the physician’s practice and the client's product. Through this campaign, I sought to create a partnership between the physicians and the Coloplast by focusing on a mutual goal—helping physicians grow leads. The co-marketing strategy also reduced practice-building compliance issues, through the joint partnership of the physician and client.

## Approach
I implemented a three-tiered strategy to identify the best opportunities for co-marketing campaigns. Critical geographic markets were determined by cross-referencing frequently searched ZIP codes on the Coloplast website against search density and traffic data to reveal areas with above-average demand. Working with the Coloplast team, I was able to identify a top physician within the opportunity area, who'd be an ideal partner for the co-marketing campaigns.

## Campaigns
Historical performance data and advanced testing methodologies guided the creation and optimization of the co-marketing campaigns.

- Top performing headlines from previous Coloplast campaigns were incorporated with local terms and physician names for a 139% lift in click-through rates
- Keyword bidding targeted consumers near the end of the conversion funnel to efficiently use ad budget and maximize physician leads
- Multiple types of bid adjustments, daily and weekly ad schedules, budget flights, and ad extensions were optimized to drive performance further

> Efficient, effective and trackable. We had tried several marketing solutions, but this has been, by far, the **most effective**."  - Participating Co-Marketing Clinic"

## Landing Pages
- 15 custom landing pages tailored for different places in the user’s customer journey were created to support the campaigns.
- Multiple CTAs with language for unique audience behaviors
- On-going conversion rate optimization (CRO) using Google Optimize to personalize landing pages and convert users in various conversion stages
- Landing pages highlighted locally relevant care clinics and capitalized on “near me” search trends.

## Reporting & Measurement"
Performance tracking was implemented and communicated in an easy-to-understand custom, monthly dashboard. Reporting included macro and micro conversion points, such as page scroll depth, to gauge intent and likelihood of visitors becoming a lead. Evaluation of phone call length to a physician’s office helped estimate lead quality. Sharing clear, measurable results increased the physician’s confidence and loyalty to Coloplast.


## OUTCOME 
- Phone call leads doubled for a majority of clinics, with some experiencing over 6x the call volume.
- Conversion rates on landing pages grew a substantial 112% over the baseline template design.
- 320% annual decrease in the cost per conversions
- Clients had a dominant share of market voice on the local search market with a 260% annual increase
