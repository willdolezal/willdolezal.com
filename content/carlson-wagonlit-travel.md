## CARLSON WAGONLIT TRAVEL
CWT had a cross-departmental pilot project in need of digital strategy support. The pilot project was focusing on a new offering to a new audience and was using a lean, agile process to identify operational efficiencies within the organization. I joined their three-day brainstorming session in Houston to kick off the relationship.

Starting with SEM support, my involvement grew to include SEO and analytics, as my teammates were being brought in to help with content development, UX and CRO support, and event tracking. Eventually, the pilot project partnered with us in the creation of a new website. This partnership has been ideal for applying outside-the-box thinking, nimble strategy recommendations, and quick-turn execution.
