## FAMILY OWNED & OPERATED

St Croix Cleaners is a family-owned and operated dry cleaner with 16 locations around the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Working with the owners, Dave and Polly Nemec, and their staff since 2014 has been a tremendous privilege for me. Their company continues to strive towards its value of delivering high-quality dry cleaning and superior customer service. Our partnership has grown over the years from local search engine optimization to text ad campaigns on Google Ads to ad hoc digital marketing consulting.

One project from our collaboration with a notable bottom line impact was the creation of a highly targeted Google Ad campaign around the store location of a recently closed competitor. Highly personalized ad copy for consumers searching to replace their old dry cleaners drove ad costs down and visitor quality up. Paired with local SEO optimization of St Croix Cleaner's nearest location, a year over year increase in visits and calls to the store was quite visible. The catalyst for this strategy came out of a general conversation with St Croix Cleaners regarding their business operations and competitors. A great sign of the value within this partnership.
