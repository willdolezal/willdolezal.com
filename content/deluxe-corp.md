## AUDIT OF FI.DELUXE.COM

Deluxe had recently acquired Wausau Financial Services and was looking to revamp their web presence on fi.deluxe.com. They had reached out for an in-depth audit to provide a roadmap forward with expansion of the site to include Wausau FS offerings. The audit explored every angle and perspective with fi.deluxe.com. From technical SEO to analytics and tracking, to backlinks and domain authority.

A content analysis of the site was one of the most impactful sections from the audit for Deluxe. Identification of underutilized content of high-value helped Deluxe rethink user flow through the website. Overlapping internal search traffic against a competitor's content allowed the Deluxe team to generate an effective content strategy.

I proved ranked recommendations following the presentation of the audit to detail the priority of next steps. These comprehensive recommendations allowed the Deluxe team to move forward in a clear direction.
