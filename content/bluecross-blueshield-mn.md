## UNDERSTANDING USAGE BY USER TYPE
SelectAccount (now Further) is a health spendingÂ and savings account administration with more than $1.5 billion in medical savings assets under their management. For over twenty-nine years, they've seamlessly connected health and finance to help people live healthier lives.

Text ad, remarketing, and Display campaigns were run to educate individuals on the benefits of health savings accounts. Tracking was set up through the entire account creation providing granular conversion details for campaign optimization.

My work with SelectAccount went beyond their marketing site, selectaccount.com, and into their three intranet portals. Each portal served a different user type, including Members, Agents, and Group Administrators. Tasks, navigation, and goals were unique to each gateway. Working in tandem with our internal development team, I was able to implement a custom navigation and conversion tracking.

Insights from user engagement and A/B usability tests guided new user-friendly designs leading to better conversion rates from users.
